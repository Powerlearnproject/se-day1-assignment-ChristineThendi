Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and development of tools and methods to develop and maintain high quality software systems that power modern life and various industries.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the development of programming languages- these are tools that were used in the development  of systems
the establishemnt of software engineering as a discipline- this helped in active study and clear focus on the principles,methodologies and structured development of systems and their application.
the advent of structured programming-the implementation of structured techniques to organize code and reuse various components to ensure its usability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements- Gathering information about user needs
design- creation of high level design and software architecture and user interface
implementation- building of the software to the set standard and design specifications.
testing- conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the set requirements.
deployment- allowing access  to the software users
maintainance- providing ongoing support to users and making improvements, changes and enhancements after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation  to the evolving needs while Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order as per the presented design.
examples of agile methodology is in the creation of a financial software system
examples of waterfall methodology is in the construction of a building.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- responsible for writing codes and implementing them to ensure build up of software solutions accordingly.
quality assuarance engineer-measures, tests and ensures that the quality of the software is to the set standard throughout its development life cycle and also meet user expectation.
project manager- ensures that execution of the project is done unto completion and delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES provide a comprehensive environment for software development, offering features such as code editing, debugging, and build automation in a single application providing tools for completion and project management. eg visual studio code
version control systems are essential for tracking changes in code, enabling collaboration through simultenous working of the same codebase , thus reducing the rate of code conflict while ensuring the integrity of the codebase. eg git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements or needs- this causes alot of delays as then the developer has to rewrite the code thus affecting delivery timelines.
tight deadlines- this leads to compromised quality as the pressure to deliver on strict deadlines increases.
prioritization of tasks is really helpful so thhat he proceess of software development doesnt get cumbersome.
use of methodoligies that favour collaboration such as agile to ensure continous improvement and flexibility.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing- done on individual components or modules of the software
integration testing- done on the different interacting components of the software
system testing-conducted on the software as whole.
acceptance testing- done to access whether the software meeets the user needs or requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The process of writing instructions or statements to get the most output of responses from ai models.
its relevant in helping provide the desired output by giving detailed yet desired information from the given prompts 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt-how to write a poem
improved prompt- write a short sweet poem about nature.
improved prompt is more effective since it will provide the specific  required details as well as maintain creativity.
